for any java class if we are allowed to creat only one object such type of class is called siingleton class
eg.runtime,buisnessdeligte,service locator

Advntage of singleton class:
if several people have same requirement than it is not recomended to create a separate object for every requuirement
we have to create only one object and we can reuse same object for every similar requirement so that
performance and memory management will be improved.
