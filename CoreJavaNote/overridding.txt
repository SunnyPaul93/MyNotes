our overriding should not effect other user
class p{
public void m1(){			//other people can access
}}
class c extends p{
public void m1(){			//other people can access
}}

class p{
public void m1(){			//other people can access
}}
class c extends p{
void m1(){			//other people cannot access
}}

oberridding applicable only for methods but not for variables 
for variables if we override than it is variable hidding
while overiding, modifiers must be higher type
in overridding method resolution always takes care by jvm based on run time
object 

in overloading mtd resolution is based on reference type by the compiler

var arg overridding
var arg mtd should overriding with another var arg mtd only but not by simple method
