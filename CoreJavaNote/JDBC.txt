Core java for standalone application i.e in any single machine

Now to develope web appln go fro advance java


Advance java:

Java Database Connectivity:
If we want to communicate with DB that technology is JDBC

Basic components of JDBC:
1.Drivers:It is a transalter to convert java calls into database calls and database calls into 
java calls

2.Connection:To communicate with database from java application 

3.Statement object:
Purpose of Statement object :to send our sql query to database and bring results from DB to java
statement object required

4:Result Set:It holds results of sql query 


Steps to develope JDBC Appln:
1.Load or register driver 
2.Estlablish connection between java appln an ddatabase
3.Create statement object 
4.Send and execute SQL queries
5.Process result from result set
6.Close connection 

JDBC is a part of java standard eddision (J2SE/JSE)
JDBC defined by java vendor and  implement this specification are Database vendors or Third party vendor 
Database vendor provide implementation  called Driver software 

Features of JDBC:
1.It is a standard API it never going to change DB to DB (connection,statement,result set are always same for mysql,oracle or third party)
2.It is DB independent API
3.Most of driver are depeloped by using JAVA language only
4.CURD operation can be performed eadily by JDBC API only


http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index-136695.html

java is DB independ but driver is DB dependent

JDBC API:
A group of classes and interfaces which can be used for DB communication and used by programmers and Driver software vendor

JDBC package:

1.java.sql	:contain basic classes and interfaces which can be used for DB communication 
2.javax.sql :java extension:conatins more advanced classes and interfaces used for DB communication



Type 4 drivers:
Also known as pure java driver as it is developed in completly developed in java only
Also known native protocol driver 
Also known as thin drivers as it won't required any extra component to communicate with database

Platform indepedent as purely developed in java
Performane is best among all drivers
Not reqd to have ODBC driver,native libaries, middle way server

Limitation:
DB dependent driver
