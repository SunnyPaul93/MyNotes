Types of Appplication:
1.Standalone Application
2.Client-server Appliction
3.Web Applicatiion
4.Distributed Application
5.Enterprise Appilcation


1.Standalone Application:Application that can be accessed by a single user at a time is called Standalone Application
Eg.MS-Word,JDK,Music Player .......................etc 
We can use C,C++,C#,Java for developing this type of application 

Problem with this type of Appln:
	~Application has to installed across all the machine so change in version will have to change across all the machine. This gives maintance problem 
	~Data transfer or sharing is not possible as every machine has its own property
All system releated software are Standalone Appln  


2.Client-server Appliction:In case of Cline-Server Application,Application has been divided into two parts.One part is installed on the server machine and other part is 
installed on multiple client machines i.e multiple client can access the centralized server.
eg.Yahoo,GTalk,   etc 

Here Data sharing problem is resolved but still maintance problem is there in client machine

Client-Server application can be implement using C,C++,Java etc
Data Sharing is possible because multiple client are accessing application from centarlized seerver 

3.Web Application:
 Here entire application will be installed on server machine only i.e multiple client can access web application from centralized server
Centralize server is a WebServer and client can interect with the WebServer using a WebClient known as Web Browser
eg.www.gmail.com,www.yahoo.com,www.youtube.com

Web Application can be implemented using Servlet,JSP,Struts,JSF,Spring MVC ......................................etc

Data sharing is possible because multiple client are accessing the application from centralized server
No maintenance problem because modification will happen only at web server


Static Web Application
------------------------------- 
Static Web Appln can be developed using simple HTML 
We cannot do interaction
Client cannot send any data to the server 
Client simply can access static data from the server

Dyanmic Web Application
------------------------------- 
Dyanmic Web Application can be develope using Servlet,JSP,Struts,Spring MVC ........................................etc
Client can send data to the server
Client can access dynamic data from the server

4.Distributed Application:Is in MyNote
5.Enterprise Appilcation:Is in MyNote






WEB BUZZ:

Web Srver:It is an  application which perform the following:
	Receives the HTTP request from the Web Client
	Process that request with the help of Web Conatiner
	Send the response to the Web Client

eg.	Apache Tomcat Server		------>Java
	PWS (Personal Web Server)		------>ASP.net	
	IIS (Internet Information Server)		------>ASP.net	

Now we can also use Application server to Process our Web appln.  Application servers used now-a-days are 
	WebLogic,WebSphere,JBoss,JRun.......................................................etc


Web Conatiner: It is an appln. which is responsible for managing the complete lifecycle of Servlet or JSP

	Web Conatiner offers the following free Services:-
	
	~Low Level Services:
		IO Streams			:Supported by both Web Container and EJB Container 
		Threads 				:Supported by both Web Container and EJB Container
		Networking 			:Supported by both Web Container and EJB Container
	~Middle Level Services:
		Resource Management		:Supported by both Web Container and EJB Container
		LifeCycle Management		:Supported by both Web Container and EJB Container
		Declarative Security Management 	:Supported by both Web Container and EJB Container but Web Container security is not too much
						 and EJB has more powerful security 
		JSP LifeCycle Support		 
		Transiction 			:Supported by EJB Container only and not by Web Container

As a developer we need to write code only for High Level Security i.e Buisness operation of Application we are developing

Web Client: Web Client is an application which performs the following:
		Send the HTTP request to Web Server
		Receive the HTTP response from Web Server
		Renders the HTML Response Data 

	eg:	InternetExplorer
		Opera 
		MorzillaFirefox
		Google Chrome
		Safari
		...................................etc

HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol):HTTP sites on the top of TCP/IP for transfering the Web Client information to the Web Server and Web Server information
			         to the Web Client
	
			
TCP/IP:	Original data transfer will be done by TCP/Ip
  	IP(Internet Protocol) is responsible for carrying the data packets from Web Client to Web Server and vice-versa
	TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) sits on the top of IP and moniter the Data Transmission
DNS:	Domain Naming Service is a registry where domain name will be binded with IP address


Web Technologies:Servlet ,JSP

Web Frramework:Stuts,JSF, Spring MVC

Notes:
	1.Web Container Responsible for creating login servlet 
	2.Service Responsible to write metadata i.e (information of appliction)
		Write in XML file
		Anotation(After Servlet 3.0)

	3.Every Form tag has some action attribute
	4.Form action and url patteren has to have same name
	4. 404 error:This error occur when Request for resource is not available



**************************************************************************************************************************
Steps to Write Servlet in Java:
	1.Write Servlet class by extending HttpServlet class
	2.Override the lifecycle methods of Servlet:
		a.public void init(Setvlet Logic sc)
		b.public void service(Http srevlet request req,Http servlet response res)
		c.public void destroy()

	We can override any of them or any two of them or all of them 
	
	Service mtd has:	a:Servlet Exception	b:IO Exception
	
	3.Configure the Servlet(either by XML code or by Using Annotation)

Eclipse:
		
1.Window
2.Preferences
3.Server
4.Runtime Environment(For First Time)
5.Add	   
	I have add Server As Tomcat v7.0
6.Next
7.Browse Where I install Tomcat7.0
	Mine is E:\\Tomcat7.0 
 8.Finish
 
To Create Project :
	File------>New------->Dynamic Web Project------>Provide Project Name--------->Next ---->Next----->check on generate web.xml

	Create one login.html under(Web Content RightClick New HTML file FileName:login.html  Finish) WebContentFolder
	Create Package as com.sunny.servlets
	Create LoginServlet.java file in package com.sunny.servlets(right click on package----->new------>servlet--->ServletName-->next-->next--->check only service method--->finish)
	In Web-Inf--->Update web.xml with login servlet configuration
	Deploy into tomcat7:
		Right click on Servlet1(say) 
		Select run as---->Run On Server
	
 
	Open Browser
	Provide url:
	http://localhost:9999/Servlet1/Login.html



*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************



Static block will be executed at time of class Loading 
Default constructor is to intilized the object 
After creating instances it will call life cycle mtd called init() to initilize the servlet
Service mtd:-To check whether service method is called 
Overridding destroy methods


NOTE:	Url pattern in <servlet-mapping> must be same as action value of HTML i.e<form>
	The Url patteren must starts with /
	<server-name> is a logical name and must be same in <servlet> and <servlet-mapping>


By  default servlet will be loaded at First Response but we can make servlet at conatiner startup explicitly by using load-on-startup

Servlet Initilization:
1.Loading the class 
2.creating the instance
3.Calling the init() mtd for initilizing the required resources






*************************************************************************************************************************************
Welcome Files:
	Default welcome files for web application are:
	index.html
	index.htm
	index.jsp
	default.html
	default.htm
	default.jsp
	
We can make one or more web resources as main web pages for our web application by specifying the welcome pages
	<welcome-file-list>	--------->Multiple files can be specified as welcome file list
	<welcome-file>login.html </welcome-file> 
	<welcome-file>default.html </welcome-file> 
	<welcome-file>index.html </welcome-file> 
	</welcome-file-list>	
	
	When we specify multiple resources(html files) in welcome file list then those files will be verified in the order wise as define in web.xml fle
	Here 
	Whenever login.html is found than that will be displayed 
	Whenever login.html is not found than it goes to default.html 
	Whenever default.html is found than that will be displayed  	
	Whenever default.html is not found than it will go for index.html 	
	Whenever index.html is found than that will be displayed  	
	............................
	...........................................
	............................. and so on

With Servlet3.0 we have to option to use welcome files:
1.Specify welcome file as above in web.xml
2.Use index.html,default.html.....................etc which are dfault welcome files




~Servlet Instance Creation:
At servlet start up the servlet is Not Loaded or Instantialte

By Default servelet instance is created when  client sends the 1st request to the servlet
Only one instance is created for one servlet and will be used to process all the request by using multiple threads 


If we want to create instance while starting the server or container (i.e To load servlet container on load-on-startup) than we use the following :

In  Xml File write:
<load-on-startup>X(here can have any number and contaiiner will be loaded at container startup only)</load-on-startup>

In Case of annotation:
@WebServlet(.............,loadOnStratup=X)
 	
Note:	X will be of int type value and should not be -ve integer
	X indicates in which order the servlet instances will be created 



~Parameters:
Parameters is a piece of information with name-value pair
Parameter name and value are of type string
Parameter is read-only i.e Web Container Stroes the parameter in the corrosponding object and we can read and use that values and we cannot modify the
parameters

There are 3 types Paramaters :
1.Servlet Request Parameters
2.Servlet Config Parameters
3.Servlet Context Parameters

All the above are done by container only. Also data storing done by Web container 

1.Servlet Request Parameters:Client submittted data which are coming form Web Client to Web Server along with Http Request are Called Request parameters 
Web container collects the client submitted data and stores that in HttpServletRequest object as RequestParameter 
As a developerr we need to collect that data from the request objects as follows:
	
How I access request parameters:
~String getParameter(String)
~String[] getParameterValues(String)
~Map<String,String[]> getParameterMap()
~Ennumeration <Strinng>  getParameterNames()


Case1:
	String nm=request.getParameter("name");				//For collecting single value
	String corses[]=request.getParameterValues("course");		//For collecting multiple values



If I have multiple vlues and if I use getParameter() than only 1st value will be displayed but If I use getParameterValues than all the values will be displayed 


Case2:
	We can use parameter names and values as a Map 
	
	Map<String,String[]> map=request.getParameterMap();		//parameter names and values consider as single map
	Set pnames=map.keySet();
	Iterator it=pnames.iterator();
	while(it.next())
	{
	String pnm=(String) it.next();
	Object val=map.get(pnm);
	String []values=(String[])val;
	SOP("\nPname :"+pnm+"\nValues");
	for(int i=0;i<values.length;i++){
	SOP(values[i]);
	}
	}
	 
 
Case3:
	We Can access only request parameter manes as:
	Ennumeration <Strinng> ens=request.getParameterNames();
	List<String> list=Collection.list(ens);
	for(String pn:list){
	String pv=request.getParametre(pn);
	SOP(pn+":"+pv);
	}
	

	

2.Servlet Config Parameters:ServletConfig is an interface available in javax.servlet package and Web Container vendor is responsible to provide the subclass for 
this interface.
Every Servlet has its own ServletConfig object and cannot be shared
When we want to use any data which is common for all the user but specific to a particular servlet then that data can be specified as ConfigParameter or init Parameter 

With Servlet 2.x:  

	Specify the config parameters in web.xml
	<servlet>
	<servlet-name>helloServ</servlet-name>
	<servlet-class>fully qualified class name<servlet-class>
	<inti-param>
		<param-name>email</param-name>
		<param-value>hello@gmail.com</param-value>
	</init-param>
	..........................................
	....................................
	.......................................
	</servlet>

With Servlet 3.0
	We can use as we are using in Servlet 2.x or we can use annotations
	Specify the config-parameters in Servlet class with annotations
	
	@WebServlet(name="helloServ",urlPattern={"/hello.jlc}",
	initParams={
		@WebInitParam(name="email",value="hello@gmail.com"),
		@WebInitParam(name="phone",value="7889888988")
		}
	)


	public class HelloServlet extends HttpServlet{
	.....................................................
	}

	Web container collects data from either web.xml or annotation and stores that in ServletConfig object as Config Parameters
	As a developer we can only collect the data from config object as follows:
		String em=config.getInitParameter("email");
	
	We can use the following methods in servlet class to access the ServletConfig object:
		public void init(ServletConfig cfg)

	We can use the following inherited method from HttpServlet:
		public ServletConnfig getServletConfig();
	
	Here when HttpServlet class init() mtd implementation is invoked from init() method then config object will be returned otherwise null will be returned 
	

3.Servlet Context Parameters:Servlet Context Parameter is a packae availbale in javax.servlet package and container vendor is responsible to provide the sub-class
for this interface 
One Web application will have only one ServletContext object i.e ServletContext object can be shared with all the  Servlet running in the application
Now when we want to use any data which is common for all the users and common to all servlets the data can be specified as Context parameter in the web.xml as

	  
		<context-param>
		<param-name>Website</param-name>
		<param-value>www.gmail.com</param-value>

		</context-param>



Web Container collects the data from web.xml and stores that in ServletContext object as Context Parameters 
	As a developer we can collect the data from context object as follows:
	String contx=context.getInitParameter("Website");




	We can use the following methods with  ServletConfig object to access the ServletContext object:

	public ServletContext getServletContext()


	We can use the following methods with  ServletConfig or ServletContext object to access the corrosponding name:
	
	Enumeration<String> ens=sc.getInitParameterNames();
	List <String> list=Collection.list(ens);
	for(String pn:list){
		String pv=sc.getIntParameter(pn);
		SOP(pn +":"+ pv);
	}






Every Time We Run Service method will be called
void setContentType(java.lang.String type): Sets the content type of the response being sent to the client, if the response has not been committed yet. The given 
content type may include a character encoding specification, for example, text/html;charset=UTF-8. The response’s character encoding is only set from the given 
content type if this method is called before getWriter is called.Before sending data to client (displayed by Browser on client machine), the Servlet container informs
the client browser of what type of data is being sent now. The data that can be sent may be simple plain text, html form, xml form, image form of type gif or jpg, 
excel sheet etc. To send this information, the Servlet container uses response object with the method setContentType().
Note: The setContentType(String) method takes a string parameter and does not return anything (returns void).








Servlet Life Cycle:
	Let I have developed an web application using the following:
	~I have written 2 servlets with names HelloServlet and HaiServlet
	~I have written 1 listener with name HelloListener
	~I have written 1 filter with name HelloFilter
	~I have configured the above components in web.xml or in annotation
	~I also configured context parameter 
	~I also configured config parameter for HelloServlet
	~I specified <load-on-startup> tag or loadOnStartup attribute for HelloServlet

Now I did the following tasks after deployingg the above said application into the server:
	~Started the Server
	~Send 1st request to HelloServlet
	~Send 2nd request to HelloServlet
	~Send 1st request to HaiServlet
	~Send 2nd request to HaiServlet  
	~Shutdown the server


Case1:Started the Server:
	When I start webserver then WebContainer is started 
	Following tasks will happen in container start-up	(Container startup for one web application only)

	1.Container read the configuration data from web.xml or Annotations specified on verious web component and stores the data in main memory (i.e checks
	if web.xml(xml file) is there or not and if not there than checks if anotations are there are not and if not there than do nothing but if either of them is there 
	then do the follwing)
	
	2.Container creates the ServletContext object and initilizes ServletContextObject with context parameter specified in web.xml (if conetext parameter is 
	there)

	3.Once context is created by WebContainer than it will create one thread pool.Now a thread pool is a special area where Java objects will run  
	i.e Java Thread pool represents a group of worker threads that are waiting for the job and reuse many times.In case of thread pool, a group of fixed size
	threads are created. A thread from the thread pool is pulled out and assigned a job by the service provider. After completion of the job, thread is contained
	in the thread pool again.
	Number of threads in a pool depends on the WebContainer vendor As a developer we cannot change the number of threads 
	
	4.Now container will see if any Listeners are configured or not and if Listener is configured than all the Listeners will be initilized  
	
	5.Now container will see if any Filters are configured or not and if Filters are configured than all the Filters will be initilized  
	
	6.Now container checks whether any servlet is configured with <load-on-startup> tag or LoadOnStartup attribute and if any Servlet is configured with
	<load-on-startup> tag or LoadOnStartup attribute then that Servlet will be initilized
	

	When the Container is initilizing the Servlet at Container start-up than Container will do the following:
	A.Servlet Class Will be Loaded 
	B.Servlet instance will be created (i.e Servlets will be instantiated) by calling Default Constructor
	C.Conatiner will cast the instance into javax.servlet.Servlet type to ensure it is a servlet
	D.Container creates the ServletConfig objects and initilizes ServletConfig object with the config parameters specified in web.xml or Annotations 
	E.ServletConfig object will be initilized with ServletContext object
	F.Conatiner calls the init() method by passing the ServletConfig object as parameter 





Case2:Sends the 1st request to Hello Servlet:
	When we 1st sends the request to the HelloServlet which is already initilized then container will do the following tasks:
	~Conatiner picks the thread from pool and assign the request processing.
	~Now the threads starts the request processing as follows:
		A.Creates the HttpServletRequest objects and initilizes that request object with incoming data coming from the client(such as request parameter,
		request header,request cookies and other imformation releated to the client )
		B.Create the HttpServletResponse object and initilize the response object with IO Streams
		C.Calls the service() method with servlet instance by passing request and response object as parameters 
		D.Once the service() method execution is completed then Stream associated with response object will be taken and that Stream will be flushed  
		to client over the network
		E.Destroy the request and response Object 

Note:	Container returns the thread to the thread pool after finishing the request processing 


Case3:Sends the 2nd request onwards to Hello Servlet:
	Now when we sends the 2nd request to the HelloServlet which is already initilized then container will do the following tasks:
	~Conatiner picks the thread from pool and assign the request processing.
	~Now the threads starts the request processing as follows:
		A.Creates the HttpServletRequest objects and initilizes that request object with incoming data coming from the client(such as request parameter,
		request header,request cookies and other imformation releated to the client )
		B.Create the HttpServletResponse object and initilize the response object with IO Streams
		C.Calls the service() method with servlet instance by passing request and response object as parameters 
		D.Once the service() method execution is completed then Stream associated with response object will be taken and that Stream will be flushed  
		to client over the network
		E.Destroy the request and response Object 


	Similarly on 3rd,4th............................................................So on 

Note:	On Every Request Service Method is Called i.e Each time the server receives a request for a servlet, the server spawns(produces) a new thread and calls
	 service.The service() method checks the HTTP request type (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and calls doGet, doPost, doPut, doDelete, etc. methods
	 as appropriate.









Case4:Sends the 1st request to Hai Servlet:
		When we 1st sends the request to the HaiServlet which is not initilized then container will do the following tasks:
		A.Servlet Class Will be Loaded 
		B.Servlet instance will be created (i.e Servlets will be instantiated) by calling Default Constructor
		C.Conatiner will cast the instance into javax.servlet.Servlet type to ensure it is a servlet
		D.Container creates the ServletConfig objects and initilizes ServletConfig object with the config parameters specified in web.xml or Annotations 
		E.ServletConfig object will be initilized with ServletContext object
		F.Conatiner calls the init() method by passing the ServletConfig object as parameter 

		
	~Conatiner picks the thread from pool and assign the request processing.
	~Now the threads starts the request processing as follows:
		A.Creates the HttpServletRequest objects and initilizes that request object with incoming data coming from the client(such as request parameter,
		request header,request cookies and other imformation releated to the client )
		B.Create the HttpServletResponse object and initilize the response object with IO Streams
		C.Calls the service() method with servlet instance by passing request and response object as parameters 
		D.Once the service() method execution is completed then Stream associated with response object will be taken and that Stream will be flushed  
		to client over the network
		E.Destroy the request and response Object 


Note:	Container returns the thread to the thread pool after finishing the request processing 




Case5:Sends the 2nd request onwards to Hai Servlet:
	Now when we sends the 2nd request to the HaiServlet which is already initilized then container will do the following tasks:
	~Conatiner picks the thread from pool and assign the request processing.
	~Now the threads starts the request processing as follows:
		A.Creates the HttpServletRequest objects and initilizes that request object with incoming data coming from the client(such as request parameter,
		request header,request cookies and other imformation releated to the client )
		B.Create the HttpServletResponse object and initilize the response object with IO Streams
		C.Calls the service() method with servlet instance by passing request and response object as parameters 
		D.Once the service() method execution is completed then Stream associated with response object will be taken and that Stream will be flushed  
		to client over the network
		E.Destroy the request and response Object 


	Similarly on 3rd,4th............................................................So on 

Note:	On Every Request Service Method is Called i.e Each time the server receives a request for a servlet, the server spawns(produces) a new thread and calls
	 service.The service() method checks the HTTP request type (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and calls doGet, doPost, doPut, doDelete, etc. methods
	 as appropriate.


Case6:ShutDown the Server:
	At conatiner shutdownn following tasks will happen:
	~Container will destroy all the Servlets but before destroying Continer will invoke the destroy() method on all the servlet 
	~Container will destroy all the Filters but before destroying Continer will invoke the destroy() method on all the filters 
	~Container will destroy all the Listeners but before destroying Continer will invoke the destroy() method on all the listeners
	~Thread pool will be destroyed
	~All objects running inside the container will destroyed and finally the conatiner is down and it is unable to process any request 
	


Request Dispatcher:	It is an intrface available in  javax.servlet packge and the subclass is implemented by container vendor 
		It has two methods as follows:
		~public void forward(ServletRequest req,ServletResponse res)
		~public void include(ServletRequest req,ServletResponse res)


~Forward() method:
		forward() method is used to forward the request from:
		Servlet to HTML
		Servlet to JSP
		Servlet to Servlet
		JSP to HTML
		JSP to JSP
		JSP to Servlet


Note:		Servlet to HTML and Servlet to JSP are mainly used in MVC

		We can place forward() method in one servlet conditionally to forward the control to other resources but only one forward() will be executed 


Usage:		
		RequestDispatcher rd=null;
		rd=requuest.getRequestDispatcher("test.html");
		rd=requuest.getRequestDispatcher("test.jsp");
		rd=requuest.getRequestDispatcher("test.jlc");
		rd.forward(request,response);

Note:		When we try to invoke two or more forward method then java.lang.IllegalStateExpression:"Cannot forward after the response has been committed"
		We can restrict the user from accessing the page directly by placing the page under WEB-INF directory
		When we have other statements after forward method then those statements will be executed but will not be able to write any content in the 
		response stream
		



~Include Method:
		include() method is used to include the response of one servlet or jsp in another servlet or jsp
		We can place many include() mtds in one servlet to include many resources and all include() mtds will be executed

		Stream will be commit automatically Once committed we cannot write any data into that stream i.e data writing is completed so if we do following;
		
		RequestDispatcher rd=requuest.getRequestDispatcher("test.html");
		rd.include(request,response)
		PrintWriter pn=response.getWriter();			than we get error

		We have to take stream before calling include() mtd once include() mtd is called we donot have the access to take i/p sttream


	


Servlet Thread Model:Servlet has implemented with 2 thread models:
		1.Single thread model
		2.Multi  thread model



		1.Single thread model:-							
				With this type of model Container creates new Servlet instance for every incoming request 
				If we want to follow single thread model for our servlet then our servlet class has to implement 
				javax.servlet.SingleThreadModel marker interface 
		class HelloServlet extends HttpServlet implements SingleThreadModel{..........................................................................}
				It is thread safe 
		
		2.Multi  thread model:
				With this type of model Container creates only one Servlet instance per Servlet and the same will be used for every 
				incoming request    
				Every container uses Multi Thread Model as Default model 
				It is not thread safe



Note:	SingleThreadModel interface is depricated in J2EE 1.4


HttpServletRequest:
~		When we send the request using http protocol than that request is called HttpRequest
		HttpRequest contains two parts:
			~HttpRequest Header 
			~HttpRequest Body
		  When we send the request with Http method GET than data will be converted to Query String and that Query String will be attached to the
		  URL
		
		http://localhost:9999/MYLAB/login.html
		With GET method the above URL will be  :--	http://localhost:9999/MYLAB/login.com?username=sunny&password=sun93	


		In case of Http GET method the data will be placed in HttpRequest Headers and HttpRequest Body is empty


		We can send our request along with the URL with the help of query
		?	:-----------To send Query Stream
		&	:-----------To take another parameter to send with the URL


~		  When we send the request with Http method POST than parameter data will be converted to Query String and that Query String will be 
		   placed in HttpRequest Body Then URL be like:---http://localhost:9999/MYLAB/login.com




		Get:---	When we send request with Http method GET than data will be attached to URL as Query String and HttpRequest Body is empty
			Using Get we can send only limited amount of data because URL limits is upto 2000 words
			GET is not secure because data will be visible in the URL
		


		Post:---	When we send request with Http method POST than data will be placed in HttpRequest Body 
			Using Get we can send  unlimited amount of data as data is stored in HttpRequest Body
			POST is more secure




		At the Server side Container is responsible for creating HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse object and Initilizes those object with data  

		HttpServerRequest contains :---
			Request Parameters 
			Request Header
			Request Cookies
			Other Informations	

		HttpServerRequest contains :---
			Response Headers 
			Response Streams in terms of Bytes and Character
