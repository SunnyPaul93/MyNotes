3.1 execution
The primary Spring PCD is execution, which matches method execution join points.


@Pointcut("execution(public String org.baeldung.dao.FooDao.findById(Long))")
This example pointcut will match exactly the execution of findById method of the FooDao class. This works, but it is not very flexible. Suppose we would like to 
match all the methods of the FooDao class, which may have different signatures, return types, and arguments. To achieve this we may use wildcards:


@Pointcut("execution(* org.baeldung.dao.FooDao.*(..))")
Here the first wildcard matches any return value, the second matches any method name, and the (..) pattern matches any number of parameters (zero or more).
