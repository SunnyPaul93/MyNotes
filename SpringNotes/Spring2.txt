Spring Data Access:-
	Spring supports two existing way to manage the DataBase connection
		1.DriverManager connection 
		2.JNDI DataSource connection 



	1.DriverManager connection :-
			When we want to use DriverManager connections we need DriverManagerDataSouurce class in Spring Configuration Documment
			and there we can inject datasource,url,un and pwd using Setter Injection(<property>)  	
			
			Now if we want to migrate from one DataBase to another DataBase than we only need to change the DriverManagerDataSouurce 
			class in Spring Configuration Documment





	2.JNDI DataSource Connections:-
		DataSource is created in JBoss Server with keeyname called JNDI name
		LDAP is running with different different WebLogic,JBOSS or ..........etc and for WebLogic,JBOSS or ..........etc factory class is also different


		By Default Authentication is disabled in LDAP server



NOTE	:-In Spring DataAccessException is root for all the DAO exception
	  Instead of diffferent exceptions for different Persistence Class one common exception is given for all(i.e for JDBC,JPA,Hibernate..............etc)	


	


SPRING DAO Support	:-
	Spring Support DAO in 3 ways	:-
		1.Provide Various DAO classes for Various Persistence Implementation as follows	:-
			a.JdbcDaoSupport
			b.HiberbateDaoSupport
			c.JPADaoSupport

		2.Provides new Exception Hirerachy with DataAccessException as root for DAO exception.
		   DataAcccessException is runtime exception so all the Spring DAO Exceptions are also runtime 
			

			org.springframework.dao.DataAccessException
			


			java.lang.Object
				java.lang.Throwable
					java.lang.Exception
						java.lang.RuntimeException
							org.springframework.core.NestedRuntimeException
								org.springframework.dao.DataAccessException
								




		3.Provides Various Exception classes for various problems comming with DataBase interraction 
			i.abstract class DataAccessException extends NestedRuntimeException
			ii.class CleanupFailureDataAccessException extends DataAccessException		//when connection is not closed
			iii.class DataAccessResourceFailureException extends DataAccessException
			iv.class DataIntegriryViolationException extends DataAccessException
			v.class DataRetrievalFailureException extends DataAccessException		//unable to retrive data
			vi.class DeadLockLoserDataAccessException extends PessimisticLockingFailureException
			vii.class IncorrectUpdateScmanticsDataAccessException extends InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException
			ix.class InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException extends DataAccessException
			x.class PessimisticLockingFailureException extends ConcurrrencyFailureException
			xi.class TypeMismatchDataAccessException extends InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException
			
			xii.abstract class UncategorizedDataAccessException extends DataAccessException	//if exceptions not recognized by Spring Team
				


	

SpringDataaccess with JDBC	:-
		
		class JDBCTemplete {
			DataSource dataSource;
		
			JDBCTemplete(){    }		
			JDBCTemplete(DataSource dataSource){
				this.dataSource=dataSource
			    }		
			
		}	
NOTE	:-We are not the author of JDBCTemplete i.e some one has implemented JDBCTemplete and they inject DataSource through Constructor Injection.
	  So when we are using this we also have to inject through Constructor Injetcion 
		
	For Suppose if default constructor if JDBCTemplete is called then there is not use of dataSource variable of type DataSource	


	When we want to perform any persisitence operation then we need to write the JDBC code as:-
		try				//1
		{				//2
			TakeConnection		//3	
			Create Statement		//4
			Prepare SQL		//5
			Submit the SQL		//6
			Process Result		//7			
		}

NOTE	:-Line 4 and 6 change if we change my SQL statement


	We can see the above problem with above JDBC code 
		1.All above statements except 4 and 6 are common for all persistence opertaion which gives us code duplication
		2.All methods of JDBC API are throwing one common exception called java.sql.SQLException which is checked exception and because of 
		  checked exception we must have to handle either by try-catch block or have to throw some exception for every exception
		3.There is no clear categorization of exception in JDBC

	The above problems can be resolved/solved by using following	:-
		1.JdbcTemplete is provided which centralizes the JDBC Code
		2.In Spring DataAccess there is only one Exception called DataAccessedException which is unchecked or runtime exception.Its not complusary
		   to handle the Exception
		3.In Spring DataAccess there is clear catogorization of Exceptions i.e for every problem there are clear exception given




NOTE	:-Above problems as discussed in JDBC we can get in HIBERNATE and JPA also 




	Methods of JDBC Templete	:-
		int update(sql)				//Delete 
		int update(sql,args)				//Insert,Update,Delete					
		int update(sql,args,argsType)			//Insert,Update,Delete


		update	:-
			public int update(java.lang.String sql)
			           throws DataAccessException

			Description copied from interface: JdbcOperations

			Issue a single SQL update operation (such as an insert, update or delete statement).

			Specified by:
				update in interface JdbcOperations

			Parameters:
				sql - static SQL to execute

			Returns:
				the number of rows affected
			
			Throws:
				DataAccessException - if there is any problem.

		

	args can be VarX or Array also 

		<ClassType> queryForObject(sql,Class type)			//select	
		Object queryForObject(sql,rowMapper)				//select	
		Object queryForObject(sql,args,rowMapper)			//select	
		Object queryForObject(sql,args,argsType,rowMapper)		//select	
		Object queryForObject(sql,args,Class)				//select	
		
		


queryForObject	:-The query is expected to be a single row/single column query; the returned result will be directly mapped to the corresponding object type
		   This method is useful for running static SQL with a known outcome
		
		Specified by:
			queryForObject in interface JdbcOperations

		Parameters:
			sql - SQL query to execute
		requiredType - the type that the result object is expected to match

		Returns:
			the result object of the required type, or null in case of SQL NULL
		Throws:
			IncorrectResultSizeDataAccessException - if the query does not return exactly one row, or does not return exactly one column in 
			that row

		DataAccessException - if there is any problem executing the query	




		RowMapper interface allows to map a row of the relations with the instance of user-defined class. It iterates the ResultSet internally and adds
		it into the collection.So we don't need to write a lot of code to fetch the records as ResultSetExtractor.





		List query(sql,rowMapper)				//select 
		List querysql,args,rowMapper)				//select 
		List query(sql,args,argsType,rowMapper)			//select 

		query	:-
			Description copied from interface: JdbcOperations

			Execute a query given static SQL, mapping each row to a Java object via a RowMapper.
			Uses a JDBC Statement, not a PreparedStatement. If you want to execute a static query with a PreparedStatement, use the
			 overloaded query method with null as argument array.

		Specified by:
			query in interface JdbcOperations

		Parameters:
			sql - SQL query to execute
		
		rowMapper - object that will map one object per row
	
		Returns:
			the result List, containing mapped objects

		Throws:
			DataAccessException - if there is any problem executing the query	




		create table customers(
			cid int PRIMARY KEY,cname CHAR(20),email CHAR(20),phone LONG,city CHAR(20)
		)





	With Annotation	:-
		Streo Type	:-
			@Repository
			@Service 		-->CustomerService,AccountService ..................etc will be automatically instantiated
			@Controller
			@Component	-->For Uncategorized Component


	And In JAVAConfiguration Document we can scan the Above marked classes by using 
		@ComponentScan(basePackages="fully qualified class name")



	It is mendatory to have DAO in any application for maintaining clean code.Now suppose I have 1000 DAOs so all those DAOs has to be instantiated 
	in Configuration class (JavaBased Annotation) so instead of insantiating all those we can use @Repository so that Spring Container will inject them 
	automatically 
	

	DAO considered as speacial bean if using @Repository so we donot need to inject that insteaad Spring Container will do that 	

	Working With Row Mapper	:-
		When we use any select statement than data will be Stored in Result Set object.Now we have to write code for collecting data from ResultSet
		object and store that data to TransferObjects
		
		SO we may get the requirement to write same code at different places whenever we execute select statement.This gives us the code duplication 
		problem.
		
		Even sometimes after closing connection our data will be lost. So we can keep these datas in RowMapper 
			 
		So we can centralized this kind of code with the help of RowMapper






Working With NamedParameterJdbcTemplete	:-
		
	With JdbcTemplete	:-i.e for Positiional
		String sql="delete from customers where cid=?"
		Object args[]={cid};
		int x=jTemp.update(sql,args);
		
		or 

		String sql="delete from customers where cid=?"
		int x=jTemp.update(sql,cid);

			


		With Row Mapper:-
		String sql="select phone from customers where email=?";
		Long phn=(Long)jTemp.queryForObject(sql,Long.class,email);
				
		or

		String sql="select city from customers where email=?";
		Object []args={email};	
		String city=(String)jTemp.queryForObject(sql,args,String.class);

		Lab113 to Lab117

		

	With NamedParameterJdbcTemplete	:-
			
		String sql="delete from customers where cid=?"
		Map<String,Object> parametes=new HashMap<String,Object>();
		parameters.put("CID",cid)
		namedParameterJdbcTemplete.update(sql,parameter)


		Lab118 to Lab122





PreparedStatementCreator	:-
		When we want to invoke any specific methods on Connections then we have to take connection in  our control.For this 
		PreparedStatementCreator is used 
		Using JdbcTemplete we donot have the access over Connections.So the connnections we can achieve through PreparedStatementCreator	  	




		update(PreparedStatementCreator) is doing	:-
		 	void update(PreparedStatementCreator	 psc){
			Connection con=ds.getConnection();
			ps=psc.createPreparedStatement(con);			///Here we are doing with connection
			ps.executeUpdate();
			}


		update(sql,args) is doing	:-
		 	void update(sql,args) {
			Connection con=ds.getConnection();
			ps=con.prepareStatement(sql);
			ps.setInt(1,....);
			.....................
			.......................................
			ps.executeUpdate();
			}





CallableStatementCreator	:-
			When we want to invoke stored procedure running in database than CallableStatementCreator is used

			Using MySQL	:-
			
			delimiter $
			create procedure addCustomer(cid int,cnm varchar(20),eml varchar(20),phn long,city varchar(20))
			begin 
			insert into customers values(cid,cnm,eml,phn,city);
			end;
			$
			delimiter ;  





SPRING DATA ACCESS USING HIBERNATE	:-
		When we want to perform any persistence operation with Hibernate then we need to write Hibernate Code like:-
			1.Write Persistence Class 
			2.Write Mapping Document or use Annotation with Persistence class 
			3.Client code 
				try{					1
					//Take Sesion Factory 		2
					//Take Session 			3
					//Begin Transiction			4
					//Perform Persistence Operation	5	
					//End Transiction 			6
					//Close Session 			7
				}catch(Exception e){..........} 	
	

		We see the following problem with above code	:-
			1.All the above statements other than 5 are common for all Persistence Operation so writing same code repeteadly cause code duplication 
			2.All the method in Hibernate API throws common exception i.e orf.hibernate.HibernateException and it is Checked Exception 
			  and because of that we must have to handle that Exception either with try-catch or throws Exception 
			3.There is no clear categorization of Exception in Hibernate 


		Above problem can be solved as follows:-
			1.HibernateTemplete is provided which Centralizes the client code
			2.In SpringDataAccess there is one root exception i.e DataAcccessException which is unchecked or runtime Exception.So its not 
			   mendatory to handle the Exception  
			3.There is clear categorization of Exception in SpringDataAccess



 



		Methods Of HibernateTemplete	:-
			1.Serializable save(Object)
			2.void update(Object)
			3.void update(Object,LockMode)
			4.void delete(Object)
			5.void delete(Object,LockMode)
			6.void deleteAll(Collection)
			
			
			7.Object load(Class,Serializable )
			8.Object load(Class,Serializable,LockMode )

			10.List find(hql)				//HQL
			11.List find(hql,Object)			//HQL
			12.List find(hql,Object [])			//HQL	//Because of VarX it can take one or more elements of Object Type

			13.List findByCriteria(DetatchedCriteria)		//QBC
			14.List findByCriteria(DetatchedCriteria,int,int)	//QBC

			15.void execute(HibernateCallback hc)

			List findByCriteria()	//NamedQuery






Lab126 and 127:-
		Run Lab Without any Opertaion like addCustomer,...........................ect Since Hibernate Will Automatically Create
		mysql> insert into customer values(101,'Sunny','sun@gmail',7826277726,'Silchar');
		Query OK, 1 row affected (0.08 sec)
		Than Run the Program
	








If I want to get Large Number of Records(say 50Lakh Records) than bettter to go With NamedQuery instead of HQL or QBC

Hibernate Callback	:-
		HibernateCallback allows us to access the Hibernate Session object directly.




Spring Transictional Management	:-
			
	Spring has its own Transictional model which is common for all persistence implementations
	Without Spring we need to use Persistence Provider specific API to manage the transictions for various persistence providers(like JDBC,Hibernate,JPA...etc)
	Various Transiction managers are provided for various persistence providers i.e
		DataSourceTransictionManager	for JDBC
		HibernateTransictionManager		for Hibernate
		JpaTransictionManager		for JPA


	PlatformTransictionManager is Root for all TransictionManagers in Spring
	
	PlatformTransictionManager  methods are	:-
		TransictionStatus	getTransiction(TransictionDefination defination)
		void 		commit(TransictionStatus status) 
		void 		rollback(TransictionStatus status)




	Spring supports folowing ways to manage transictions	:-
		Programmatic Transictions
		Declarative Transictions with AOP using Annotation support			
		Declarative Transictions with AOP using Schema support			
		Declarative Transictions with AOP using TransictionProxyFactoryBean	(Currently not used i.e OutDated)





create table accounts(accno int primary key,bal double,atype char(2));
insert into accounts values(101,50000,'SA');
insert into accounts values(102,35000,'CA');
insert into accounts values(103,45500,'SA');




TransictionManager must either inject in HibernateAccountDAO,......................etc or initilized in XML configuration File 




SPRING MVC(Model View Controller)	:-
		Spring MVC is a WebFramework like Struts1,Struts2 and JSF
		Spring MVC is use to develope web application easily and quickly with less maintenance
		Sprinf MVC covers WebLayer which includes Persistence Layer and Controller 

		Spring MVC is based on:-
		MVC Architecture 
		FrontControllerDesignPattern
		Servlet and JSP


		For Spring MVC FrontController is DispatcherSrevlet





After Deploying and Strating SpringMVC based web Application
	 Following Tasks will happen at Container Startup:-
	1.Web container creates,loads and initilized Dispatcher by inti() method
	2.DispatcherServlet's init method() will perform the following	:-
		a.Identifies Spring Container Document file
		b.Spring instance will be created by reading all the beans from that Identified Spring Configuration Document
		c.Initilizes DispatcherServlet with Spring Conatiner instances


	 Following Tasks will happen at Container Shutdown time:-
	1.Web Conatiner calls destroy() method of DispatcherServlet 
	2.destroy() method of DispatcherServlet destroy all the Spring Conatiner instances








SPRING MVC 
	
	A.XML Based Spring MVC
	B.Annotation Based Spring MVC




Spring Framework

	1.XML Config
	2.Java Config


	Follwing Combinations	:-
	A1 is allowed		Spring MVC XML with Bean Config with XML
	A2 is not allowed		Spring MVC XML with Bean Config with JAVA
	B1 is allowed		Spring MVC Annotation with Bean Config with XML
	B2 is allowed		Spring MVC Annotation with Bean Config with JAVA




Spring MVC Flow	:-
	1.DispatcherServlet takes the incoming request 
	2.DsipatcherServlet contacts Handler Mapping with incoming request URI(/course.sunny) say
	3.Handler Mapping identifies and return the Controller specifies(CourseController) specified for request URI(/course.sunny)
	4.DispatcherServlet Identfies and invokes one or more Handler Interceptors registered in Spring Container if any and then DS invokes the controller 		
		a.handlerRequestInternal() mtd of CourseController		--with XML
		b.getCourse() or some other methods of CourseController	--with Annotation here method name can be abything

	5.After finishing the Controller method execution all the registered Handler Interceptors  will be called in reverse order 				
		a.Finally DS gets ModelAndView class Object containing the view logical name and model data 			--with XML
		b.Finally DS gets view logical name								---with Annotation
	6.DS contacts View Resolver with view logical name(show)
	7.DS gets the view(/show.jsp) from View Resolver 
	8.DS forward the identified View(/show.jsp) to the Client 



When any problem comes while processing the request we can handle the request in two ways	:-
	a.Handle as Exception
	b.Handle as Error




Controller Layer Components :-
	1.Dispatcher Servlet :-DS is front Controller Component which is responsible for the following:-
		a.Receives the incoming request 
		b.Process the request completely 
		c.Deliver the respopnse 

	2.Handler Mapping :-
		Handler Mapping is responsible for identifying the corrsoponding controller for incoming request URI
		All the Handler Mapping are subclass of HandlerMapping interface

		Following are various Handler Mapping Provided :-
			BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping 			//Default --------For XML
			DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping		//Deprecated----For Annotation
			RequestMappingHandlerMapping		//Default----------For Annotation	
			SimpleUrlHandlerMapping			//XML
			ControllerBeanNameHandlerMapping		//XML
			ControllerClassNameHandlerMapping		//XML



		BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping	:-This is the default Handler Mapping which will be register by Spring Conatiner actomatically in case of 
		SpringMVC XML .This Handler Mapping checks whether any bean is available whose name is same as incoming request URI  

		DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping:-This checks whether any method is availble in Controller class whose @RequestMappping value is same 
		as incoming request URI   
			
		RequestMappingHandlerMapping:-This scans all @RequestMapping annotation in all controller classes.It provides a method setInterceptor() 
		to add interceptor.This is the default Handler Mapping which will be register by Spring Conatiner actomatically in case of SpringMVC XML 
		This is given later.

		Both DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping and RequestMappingHandlerMapping tasks are almost same



		3.Handler Interceptors	:-
			It is invoked before and after the controller invocation for performing pre-proccessing and post-processing tasks.We can have one 
			or more HandlerIntreceptors in an application 




		perHandle():-
				This method is called just before the controller method 
				This methos returns Boolean value 
				When preHandle() method returns true then the Interceptors or Controller in HandleExecutionChain will be called 
				When preHandle() method returns false then Control will be returned to the Client without invoking Interceptors or 
				Controller in HandleExecutionChain and no view will be renderd 


		postHandle():-		This method will be called immediately after the controller method execution 
  		
		afterCompletion()	:-	This method is called just before sending response 

		UsingHandlerInterceptorAdapter	:-
					HandlerInterceptorAdapter is subclasss of HandlerInterceptor inetrface and override all these three metods.
					We can write our own Interceptor class by extending HandlerInterceptorAdapter and have to oberride all 
					these three methods
						




	Controller	:-
		Controller is the last component in Controller Layer from where Business Layer starts
		Controller is mainly responsible to 
			1.Collect the client submited data from Command Object 
			2.Calls Model Component
			3.If Error occured then can be handled in two ways :-
				a.throws as Exception(Handle Exception)    
				b.Add as Error(Handle Error)
			4.If data is returned without any error then stores that in any scope and View Logical Name	
				
		
		Note:- Only one instances will be created per Controller for all the users
		




	Tiles Frameork:-	Tiles framework is mainly a Layout design framework which allows us to centralized the web page layout or templetes,text formats,
			styles required...................etc
			Tiles is a saperate Framework but not a part of SpringMVC Fraemwork 		
			We can intergate Tiles Framework with SpringMVC,JSF1.x,JSF2.x,Struts1.x................etc


			Spring provides integration support with apache tiles framework. So we can simply manage the layout of the Spring MVC 
			application by the help of spring tiles support.


			Advantage of Tiles support in Spring MVC
			
			Reusability: We can reuse a single component in multiple pages like header and footer components.
			
			Centralized control: We can control the layout of the page by a single template page only.

			Easy to change the layout: By the help of single template page, we can change the layout of the page anytime. So our website can 
			easily adapt new technologies such as bootstrap, jquery etc.





		SpringLab155 and SpringLab156


	File Upload:-

		SpringLab157 and SpringLab158

		File Upload is given by Spring but for File Download follow as we did in Servlet File Download



	I18N	:-
		SpringLab159




SpringLab160	:-

mysql> create table contacts(cid int primary key auto_increment,cname varchar(25),cemail varchar(50),cphone varchar(10));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.91 sec)



CGLIB is a code genration library. Spring uses CGLIB, to generate proxies.





SpringSecurity with XML using default login page:-
	
	SpringLab161-SpringLab163

SpringSecurity with Annotation using default login page:-
	
	SpringLab164-SpringLab165


SpringSecurity with XML using custom login page:-
	
	SpringLab166 



In Default Login Page Some default message for login and logout 

In Custom Login Page we define message for login and logout 


	SpringLab167:-

create table springusers(
	username varchar(45) primary key,
	password varchar(45) not null,
	enabled tinyint not null
	 );

insert into springusers values('sunny','sunny',true);
insert into springusers values('mohan','mohan',true);
insert into springusers values('kshiti','kshiti',false);


create table springusers_roles(
	user_role_id int primary key,
	username varchar(45) not null,
	role varchar(45) not null,
	foreign key(username) references springusers(username)		
	);


insert into springusers_roles values(1,'sunny','ROLE_ADMIN');
insert into springusers_roles values(2,'sunny','ROLE_EMP');
insert into springusers_roles values(3,'mohan','ROLE_EMP');
insert into springusers_roles values(4,'kshiti','ROLE_ADMIN');



Here we cannot take like has any form multiple so for multiple we have to take same user name to insert multiple times with different role .For say sunny is taken 
as ADMIN and EMP 


mysql> select * from springusers;
+----------+----------+---------+
| username | password | enabled |
+----------+----------+---------+
| kshiti   | kshiti   |       0 |
| mohan    | mohan    |       1 |
| sunny    | sunny    |       1 |
+----------+----------+---------+
3 rows in set (0.04 sec)

mysql> select * from springusers_roles;
+--------------+----------+------------+
| user_role_id | username | role       |
+--------------+----------+------------+
|            1 | sunny    | ROLE_ADMIN |
|            2 | sunny    | ROLE_EMP   |
|            3 | mohan    | ROLE_EMP   |
|            4 | kshiti   | ROLE_ADMIN |
+--------------+----------+------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)




NOTE	:-

	With XML we can either use 
		<security:user-service ....................................... />		//Check values from inMemory
			or
		<security:jdbc-user-service ....................................... />		//Check values from DataBase



	With Annotation we can either use

	public void configureGlobal(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception{
		auth.inMemoryAuthentication().withUser("sunny").password("sunny").roles("ADMIN");		////Check values from inMemory
		auth.inMemoryAuthentication().withUser("mohan").password("mohan").roles("EMP");
		auth.inMemoryAuthentication().withUser("kshiti").password("kshiti").roles("EMP","ADMIN");

		}
	
		or 

	public void configureGlobal(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception{
		auth.jdbcAuthentication().dataSource(dataSource)						//Check values from DataBase
		.usersByUsernameQuery("select usename,password,enabled from springusers where username=?")
		.authoritiesByUsernameQuery("select usename,role from springusers_roles where username=?");

		}
	





mvc:annotation- config mvc	:-annotation-driven is used for enabling the Spring MVC components with its default configurations.

			If you don’t include mvc:annotation-driven then also your MVC application would work, if you have
			used the context:component-scan for creating the beans or defined the beans in your XML file.

			But, mvc:annotation-driven does some extra job on configuring the special beans that would not have been configured if you are 
			not using this element in your XML file.

			This tag would register the HandlerMapping and HandlerAdapter required to dispatch requests to your @Controllers. In addition, 
			it also applies some defaults based on what is present in your classpath.

			Such defaults are:

			Using the Spring 3 Type ConversionService as a simpler and more robust alternative to JavaBeans PropertyEditors
			Support for formatting Number fields with @NumberFormat
			Support for formatting Date, Calendar, and Joda Time fields with @DateTimeFormat, if Joda Time is on the classpath
			Support for validating @Controller inputs with @Valid, if a JSR-303 Provider is on the classpath
			Support for reading and writing XML, if JAXB is on the classpath
			Support for reading and writing JSON, if Jackson is on the classpath






context:annotation-driven context	:-annotation-config is used for activating annotations in beans already registered in the application context.

				That means it will resolve @Autowired and @Qualifier annotations for the beans which are already created and 
				stored in the spring container.

				context:component-scan can also do the same job, but context:component-scan will also scan the packages for registering
				the beans to application context.

				context:annotation-config will not search for the beans registration, this will only activate the already registered beans in
				the context.
